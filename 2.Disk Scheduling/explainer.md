# 💿 Disk Scheduling - The Elevator Adventure! 

## 🌟 The Magical Disk Story

Imagine you're the operator of a super-fast elevator in a tall building where people on different floors are calling for service. Your job? Get to everyone as quickly as possible while minimizing the total travel time! This is exactly what disk scheduling algorithms do - they decide the best order to visit different "floors" (tracks) on a spinning disk! 🏢

---

## 🎭 Understanding Our Simple Code

### 📖 The Setup - Our Elevator Control Room
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main() {
    int requests[100], n, head, disk_size, choice;
```

**Meet Our Variables - The Elevator Equipment:**
- `requests[100]`: 📋 List of floors people want to visit (up to 100 requests)
- `n`: 📊 How many people are waiting for the elevator
- `head`: 🎯 Current floor where our elevator is located
- `disk_size`: 🏢 Total number of floors in our building
- `choice`: 🎮 Which elevator strategy we want to use

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Setting Up Our Elevator System

### 📝 Getting the Building Information
```c
printf("\n========== DISK SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS ==========\n");

printf("\nEnter number of requests: ");
scanf("%d", &n);

printf("Enter request sequence:\n");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    printf("Request %d: ", i + 1);
    scanf("%d", &requests[i]);
}

printf("Enter initial head position: ");
scanf("%d", &head);

printf("Enter disk size: ");
scanf("%d", &disk_size);
```

**What's happening?** 🤔
1. **"How many people need the elevator?"** → We store this in `n`
2. **"Which floors do they want to visit?"** → We fill our `requests[]` list
3. **"Which floor is the elevator currently on?"** → We store this in `head`
4. **"How many floors does the building have?"** → We store this in `disk_size`

**Example:**
- 5 people waiting: `n = 5`
- They want floors: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14 → `requests[] = {98, 183, 37, 122, 14}`
- Elevator currently on floor 53: `head = 53`
- Building has 200 floors: `disk_size = 200`

## 🎮 Step 2: The Elevator Strategy Menu

### 🎯 Choosing Our Strategy
```c
printf("\n=======================================\n");
printf("DISK SCHEDULING MENU\n");
printf("=======================================\n");
printf("1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)\n");
printf("2. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)\n");
printf("3. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)\n");
printf("4. Exit\n");
```

**Three Amazing Strategies:**
1. **FCFS**: "Serve people in the order they called" 📞
2. **SCAN**: "Go up first, then come down" 🔄
3. **C-SCAN**: "Always go in one direction, then jump back" 🔁

---

## 🚀 Strategy 1: FCFS - The Fair but Slow Method

### 🎪 The Simple Approach
```c
case 1: {
    int total = 0, current = head;
    printf("\n--- FCFS ALGORITHM ---\n");
    printf("Order of service: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", requests[i]);
        total += abs(requests[i] - current);
        current = requests[i];
    }
    printf("\nTotal head movement: %d\n", total);
    break;
}
```

**What's happening?** 🎭
1. **Start at current floor** (`current = head`)
2. **Visit each floor in order they called**
3. **Calculate distance traveled**: `abs(destination - current_floor)`
4. **Move to that floor**: `current = requests[i]`
5. **Keep adding up total distance**

**Example Journey:**
- Start at floor 53
- Go to 98: Distance = |98 - 53| = 45
- Go to 183: Distance = |183 - 98| = 85  
- Go to 37: Distance = |37 - 183| = 146
- Total so far: 45 + 85 + 146 = 276

**The Problem:** Lots of back-and-forth movement! 😵

## 🎢 Strategy 2: SCAN - The Smart Elevator

### 🧠 The Intelligent Approach
```c
case 2: {
    int left[100], right[100], l = 0, r = 0;
    int seek = 0, temp;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (requests[i] < head)
            left[l++] = requests[i];
        else
            right[r++] = requests[i];
    }
```

**The Smart Sorting:** 🎯
- **Left Group**: All floors below current floor
- **Right Group**: All floors above current floor
- **Strategy**: Visit all floors in one direction, then reverse!

### 🔄 The Sorting Magic
```c
left[l++] = 0;  // Add ground floor to left group

// Sort left group in descending order (high to low)
for (int i = 0; i < l - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < l - i - 1; j++) {
        if (left[j] > left[j + 1]) {
            temp = left[j];
            left[j] = left[j + 1];
            left[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}

// Sort right group in ascending order (low to high)
for (int i = 0; i < r - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < r - i - 1; j++) {
        if (right[j] > right[j + 1]) {
            temp = right[j];
            right[j] = right[j + 1];
            right[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

**The Sorting Strategy:** 📊
- **Left floors**: Sort from highest to lowest (so we can go down smoothly)
- **Right floors**: Sort from lowest to highest (so we can go up smoothly)

### 🎪 The Elevator Journey
```c
printf("\n--- SCAN ALGORITHM ---\n");
printf("Order of service: ");
int current = head;

// Go down first (visit left group in reverse order)
for (int i = l - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    printf("%d ", left[i]);
    seek += abs(current - left[i]);
    current = left[i];
}

// Then go up (visit right group in order)
for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
    printf("%d ", right[i]);
    seek += abs(current - right[i]);
    current = right[i];
}
```

**The Journey Explained:** 🚀
1. **Go down first**: Visit all floors below current floor
2. **Go all the way to ground floor** (floor 0)
3. **Then go up**: Visit all floors above original position
4. **No more back-and-forth!**

---

## 🎠 Strategy 3: C-SCAN - The Circular Elevator

### 🔁 The Circular Magic
```c
case 3: {
    int queue[100], size, pos, seek = 0, temp;
    
    // Add all requests plus special floors
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        queue[i] = requests[i];
    
    queue[n] = head;           // Current floor
    queue[n + 1] = 0;          // Ground floor
    queue[n + 2] = disk_size - 1;  // Top floor
    size = n + 3;
```

**The Setup:** 🏗️
- **Add all requested floors**
- **Add current floor** (where we are now)
- **Add ground floor** (0)
- **Add top floor** (disk_size - 1)

### 🎯 The Sorting and Finding
```c
// Sort everything in ascending order
for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < size - i - 1; j++) {
        if (queue[j] > queue[j + 1]) {
            temp = queue[j];
            queue[j] = queue[j + 1];
            queue[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}

// Find where we are in the sorted list
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (queue[i] == head) {
        pos = i;
        break;
    }
}
```

**The Strategy:** 🎪
1. **Sort all floors from lowest to highest**
2. **Find our current position** in this sorted list
3. **Always go in one direction** (up), then jump back to start

### 🚀 The Circular Journey
```c
printf("\n--- C-SCAN ALGORITHM ---\n");
printf("Order of service: ");

// Go up from current position to end
for (int i = pos; i < size; i++) {
    printf("%d ", queue[i]);
    if (i != pos)
        seek += abs(queue[i] - queue[i - 1]);
}

// Jump back to beginning (this costs distance!)
seek += abs(queue[size - 1] - queue[0]);

// Continue from beginning to where we started
for (int i = 0; i < pos; i++) {
    printf("%d ", queue[i]);
    if (i != 0)
        seek += abs(queue[i] - queue[i - 1]);
}
```

**The Circular Magic:** 🎠
1. **Go up** from current floor to top floor
2. **Jump instantly** back to ground floor (like teleporting!)
3. **Continue going up** until we reach where we started
4. **Always moving in same direction** = more predictable!

## 🎭 A Complete Adventure Example

Let's follow a mini-adventure with these requests: [98, 183, 37, 122, 14]
Starting position: Floor 53, Building height: 200 floors

### 🚶 FCFS Journey (The Random Walk)
```
Path: 53 → 98 → 183 → 37 → 122 → 14
Distances: 45 + 85 + 146 + 85 + 108 = 469 floors total
```
**Problem**: Lots of zigzagging! 😵‍💫

### 🎢 SCAN Journey (The Smart Elevator)
```
Left group: [37, 14, 0] (below 53)
Right group: [98, 183, 122] (above 53)

Path: 53 → 37 → 14 → 0 → 98 → 122 → 183
Distances: 16 + 23 + 14 + 98 + 24 + 61 = 236 floors total
```
**Much better!** Only one direction change! 🎯

### 🎠 C-SCAN Journey (The Circular Elevator)
```
Sorted: [0, 14, 37, 53, 98, 122, 183, 199]
Current position: index 3 (floor 53)

Path: 53 → 98 → 122 → 183 → 199 → (jump) → 0 → 14 → 37
Distances: 45 + 24 + 61 + 16 + 199 + 14 + 23 = 382 floors total
```
**Most predictable!** Always going up! 🔄

## 🎪 The Magic Behind Each Algorithm

### 🎯 FCFS - The Fair Friend
**Philosophy**: "First come, first served - it's only fair!"
- **Pros**: Super simple, no one gets ignored
- **Cons**: Can be very slow with lots of back-and-forth

### 🎢 SCAN - The Smart Planner  
**Philosophy**: "Let's be smart about this - go one way, then the other!"
- **Pros**: Much faster than FCFS, still fair
- **Cons**: People at the ends might wait longer

### 🎠 C-SCAN - The Consistent Performer
**Philosophy**: "Always go the same direction - predictability is key!"
- **Pros**: Most consistent response times
- **Cons**: Sometimes travels further due to the "jump back"

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Key Concepts

### 📏 Distance Calculation
```c
total += abs(requests[i] - current);
```
**The Magic Formula**: `Distance = |Destination - Current Position|`
- The `abs()` function ensures we always get a positive distance
- Whether going up or down, distance is always positive!

### 🔄 The Sorting Algorithms
The bubble sort used in the code:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < size - i - 1; j++) {
        if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
            // Swap elements
            temp = array[j];
            array[j] = array[j + 1];
            array[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```
**What it does**: Arranges floors in order (like organizing elevator buttons!)

### 🎯 The Menu System
```c
do {
    // Show menu
    // Get choice
    // Execute algorithm
} while (choice != 4);
```
**The Loop**: Keeps running until user chooses to exit!

## 🏆 Why These Algorithms Matter

### 🎭 Real-World Connection
In computers:
- **Floors** = Tracks on a hard disk
- **Elevator** = Disk read/write head
- **People** = Programs requesting data
- **Building** = Entire disk surface
- **Distance** = Time to move the head

### 🎯 The Problem They Solve
**Disk Access Optimization**: When multiple programs need data from different parts of the disk, these algorithms decide the best order to access them, minimizing the time spent moving the disk head.

### ✨ The Beauty of Optimization
These algorithms show how smart planning can dramatically improve performance:
- **FCFS**: Simple but inefficient
- **SCAN**: Smart and efficient  
- **C-SCAN**: Consistent and predictable
